# Mech Designer

[My Notes](notes.md)

A webpage that allows users to create an account and then create datasheets for mechs/robots with interchangable parts that they can save and share their creations as well as browse through creations by other users.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

I like many others have been a big fan of large robots and mechs and the ability to customize them. Whether someone is a fan of pacific rim, armored core, or any other robot/mech form of media they have probably imagned creating one of their own. This allows them to crete an idea for it parts that they can select and apply to a body that will give them stats such as speed, firepower, and armor. With these datasheets these people can go on and then use these designs they made in their own way whether create a 3d model or create a drawing to match it.

    User->>Server: Browse other users' mechs
    Server->>Database: Query shared designs
    Database-->>Server: Return mech gallery
    Server-->>User: Display community creations
```

### Key features

- Users are able to create an account and then able to login later to save data
- Secure Login and authentication
- Users are given a template to create a datasheet for a mech/robot with customisable parts that affect certain characteristics/statistics of the model
- Multiple options for each part selection piece
- Users are able to share their creation with others and then are able to browse what others have created 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - This will be utilized to build out the framework for the actual website
- **CSS** - This will be utilized to create the styling and actual format for the website as well as the styling of the input sheet
- **React** - The code for user interaction with the webpages such as login and entering other information for mechs
- **Service** - Service with endpoints for retreiving options, submitting information to DB, and login and authentication services
- **DB/Login** - User data and other information will be stored in a database as well as user login and information to store their designs
- **WebSocket** - Websocket will be shared so that other users can view the mockups and creations of other users
